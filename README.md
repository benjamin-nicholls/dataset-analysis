CMP3749M Big Data - Assessment 2 - Dataset Analysis and MapReduce

Analysis of the Nuclear Plants dataset:
- Check for missing files.
- Show summary statistics.
- Show box plots.
- Show correlation matrix.
- Show heat map of correlation matrix.
- Shuffle into training-test split.
- Count samples.
- Train a decision tree, support vector machine, and an artificial neural network.
- Make predictions and evaluate the classifiers.

MapReduce for Margie Travel dataset:
- Determine the number of flights from each airport; include a list of any airports not used.
- Create a list of flights based on the Flight id, this output should include number of passengers, relevant IATA/FAA codes, and departure and arrival times (times converted to HH:MM format).
- Calculate the line-of-sight (nautical) miles for each flight and the total travelled by each passenger and thus output the passenger having earned the highest air miles.
